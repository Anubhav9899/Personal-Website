          As a passionate MERN Stack Developer with strong proficiency in C,
          C++, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, I thrive in
          building scalable, high-performance web applications and solving
          complex problems through innovative software solutions. My experience
          includes both front-end and back-end development, where I have
          successfully developed and optimized web applications, significantly
          improving user experience and overall efficiency. In addition to my
          development expertise, I have a keen interest in algorithmic trading,
          where I apply my programming skills to develop and test trading
          strategies. My technical toolkit also includes HTML/CSS, RESTful APIs,
          version control with Git, and database management, which enable me to
          create robust and efficient applications. My ability to quickly adapt
          to new technologies and my commitment to continuous learning have been
          key in delivering high-quality results in fast-paced environments. I
          am currently seeking new opportunities where I can leverage my
          technical skills to contribute to impactful projects. I am eager to
          join a dynamic team that values innovation and offers opportunities
          for professional growth.
