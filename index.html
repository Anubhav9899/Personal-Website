          A passionate MERN Stack Developer with strong proficiency in DSA,
          JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, I thrive in
          building scalable, high-performance web applications and solving
          complex problems through innovative software solutions. My experience
          includes both front-end and back-end development, where I have
          successfully developed and optimized web applications, significantly
          improving user experience and overall efficiency. In addition to my
          development expertise, I have a keen interest in algorithmic trading,
          where I apply my programming skills to develop and test trading
          strategies. My technical toolkit also includes HTML/CSS, RESTful APIs,
          version control with Git, and database management, which enable me to
          create robust and efficient applications. My ability to quickly adapt
          to new technologies and my commitment to continuous learning have been
          key in delivering high-quality results in fast-paced environments. I
          am currently seeking new opportunities where I can leverage my
          technical skills to contribute to impactful projects. I am eager to
          join a dynamic team that values innovation and offers opportunities
          for professional growth.

    <h3>Codeclarify</h3>
    <p>
      Created CodeClarify using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). It allows users to ask programming-related questions, provide answers, comment, and upvote/downvote content, with a reputation system based on user activity. Users can create profiles, post and manage questions and answers, search via tags, and engage in real-time updates like notifications. Key features include JWT-based authentication, a voting and reputation system, badges, and an admin panel for content moderation. The platform supports structured discussions with markdown support for code and text formatting.

            <h3>Netflix Clone</h3>
            <p>
             Built a Netflix clone using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to replicate the popular streaming serviceâ€™s user interface with precision and attention to detail. The application features a dynamic movie carousel powered by real-time data, a fully responsive design, and interactive elements such as hover effects, search functionality, and filtering options for a seamless viewing experience. Integrated React for efficient component management and state handling, using React Router for smooth page transitions and navigation. This project showcases my ability to implement complex UI/UX patterns, optimize performance, and handle real-world challenges in building scalable, data-driven web applications with modern technologies.

            <h3>Image Classifier</h3>
            <p>
             Developed an image classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with TensorFlow and Keras to accurately distinguish between dogs and cats. Implemented data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming to enhance the training dataset and prevent overfitting. Utilized Pandas and NumPy for efficient data handling and preprocessing, ensuring robust model training and evaluation. The classifier achieved a high accuracy rate by leveraging techniques like early stopping and dropout layers to optimize performance. This project demonstrates my proficiency in machine learning, deep learning techniques, and the ability to build, fine-tune, and deploy complex models capable of solving real-world classification problems.
